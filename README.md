README: Scorpio Games – Steam Clone
Welcome to Scorpio Games, a full-stack digital distribution platform clone modeled after Steam. This project was developed as a final lab project for the Web Technologies Lab, focusing on modern frontend development with React.js, real-time communication with Socket.io, and persistent data management using MySQL.

Interactive Authentication: A secure login/signup system featuring an animated Panda UI that reacts to user input.


Real-Time Live Chat: Instant messaging between friends powered by Socket.io, with permanent history stored in MySQL.




Scorpio Wallet: A functional digital wallet where users can redeem gift card vouchers and purchase games.



Social System: Features to search for friends, send/accept friend requests, and track online status.



Account Recovery: A secure "Reset Password" flow utilizing security questions and Bcrypt encryption.
